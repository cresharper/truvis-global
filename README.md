# ch-buildkit

All of my pet projects start here. Pretty straightforward setup:

1. npm install
2. gem install jekyll

All work is done in the "dev" folder and is built out into the "build" folder. 

All my HTML is generated using Jekyll - specifically the [Liquid](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating engine. SASS is used for CSS preprocessing and JS resides in functions live in dev/js/functions.js :)
